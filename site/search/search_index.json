This engine (really just a module) is a handy way to save all your print() code into one file. It loads a .json file, then builds a .py file from that. How do I use it? Very good question.

Keys in the JSON file become function names. Items in the array attached to the key becomes the text printed to the screen. This JSON file is called textdump.json , and it is in the folder called engine/ . The rules for editing the JSON goes by the following: It must follow JSON syntax rules You may have as many keys as you like A key's value must be an array / list The list may have as many values as necessary Importing the Engine Now here comes the true brilliance of the module. You don't need to run any init() functions! By importing the file that supplies the text functions, it automatically rebuilds and reloads the file!
