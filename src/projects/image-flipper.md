# [Image Flipper](https://repl.it/@BD103/Image-Flipper)
Have you ever wanted to rename all the images in a Minecraft resource pack to other images, so someone can get really confused? Or maybe play Undertale with Flowey looking like Undyne's spear? That's why I created this image flipper. Fork the repl, the upload a folder or `.zip` file with images inside it! It will then rename them all, essentially flipping the data between the `.png`s. This only works for `.png` files, and it will only find the images inside the main folder. It will not go into folders inside the folder specified. I was working on adding a `.flipignore` file that is just a plain text array that specifies images that it won't flip, but this feature isn't implemented yet. This program is free to use! Enjoy!

Try typing `imgs.zip` in the program! Also, don't run more than 20,000 rotations, it crashes repl.it! :)
