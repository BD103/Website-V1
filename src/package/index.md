# [BD103 Personal Package for Python](https://pypi.org/project/BD103/)
I basically throw a bunch of completely random and almost useless functions into a package.

Download it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/BD103/) or just run `pip install BD103`.

Find the source code on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@BD103/BD103-Python-Package).

This package is in Beta, so there will most definitely be bugs.

## Use
You do not need to import anything specific, unless you are importing from `engine`.
